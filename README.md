# GMIT Python Problem Set

This is a repository of my solutions to the Python problem set for the Programming and Scripting module in the GMIT Computing (Data Analytics) Higher Diploma for the January to May 2019 semester. The problem sets cover some of the basics of Python, including variables, loops, and data manipulation, as well as the use of the command line to run the code. 

The aforementioned problem set is available at the following location:

##Prerequites

Ensure Python is installed on your machine to be able to run the code.

Is it also recommended that you install Cmder, a command-line interface with greater functionality than the regular Windows console, for runnning the programs. 

##File Descriptions and Usage

Problem1.py asks for the user input of a positive integer, then sums all integers between one and the input number.

Problem2.py is run by itself. It checks whether the current day of the week starts with a "T".

Problem3.py is run by itself. It prints all numbers between 1000 and 10000 that are divisible by 6 but not 12.

Problem4.py asks for the input of a positive integer and performs a calculation on that number. It calculates the next value
by taking the current value and, if it is even, dividing it by two, but if it is odd, multiplying
it by three and add one. It then ends the program if the current value is one.

Problem5.py asks for the input of a positive integer and checks whether that number is a prime number.

Problem6.py asks for the input of a string, then returns every second word of that string.

Problem7.py asks for the input of a positive number and an estimated answer to what the approximate square root of the positive number might be. It then uses that estimate to approximate the square root of the number via the Newtonian method.

Problem8.py is run by itself. It takes today's date and time and prints it in the format: Monday, January 10th 2019 at 1:15pm.

Problem9.py takes an argument at the command line. The argument shpould be the name of a text file, which the program reads and prints out every second line.

Problem10.py is run by itself. It makes use of pyplot to plot a function of x, x^2 and 2^x in range [0,4]
