# GMIT Python Problem Set

This is a repository of my solutions to the Python problem set for the Programming and Scripting module in the GMIT Computing (Data Analytics) Higher Diploma for the January to May 2019 semester. The problem sets cover some of the basics of Python, including variables, loops, and data manipulation, as well as the use of the command line to run the code. 

The aforementioned problem set is available at the following location:
